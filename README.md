# Time_Showing_Assistant_by_ADK
This is an AI Assistant which shows live-time of different given city created by Google ADK.

# Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible and modular framework for developing and deploying AI agents. While optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem, ADK is model-agnostic, deployment-agnostic, and is built for compatibility with other frameworks.

##1. Need to install ADK in local machine:
pip install google-adk

##2. Install some more libraries to get real datetime:

pip install geopy

pip install timezonefinder

pip install datetime

##3. Create ADK agent and configure it as per the steps as showed below in cmdline:

You will require API Key as well. Get it from Google AI Studio.

##4. The ADK repository will be visible to you in the filepath of the local machine. Update the agent.py and add instructions to show live-time of asked cities in realtime.

##5. Run the adk agent from the terminal now and ask questions:
